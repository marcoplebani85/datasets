All but three datasets presented here were created using computer simulations within the program R. The only exceptions are:

- flower_color_spectra.txt, based on real data but presented here with non-specific species names;

- unicorns.csv, based on real data from a mammal species but transformed in various ways;

- RIKZ.csv, marine benthic data collected by the Dutch institute RIKZ in the summer of 2002 and presented here as in the R package AED by Lu≈°trik e Stachelek (https://github.com/romunov/AED/).
